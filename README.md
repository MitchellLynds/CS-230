Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a client of CTS that has an Android app for the game: Draw it or Lose it. The Gaming Room wants to expand the game to other platforms other than just Android   by creating a web-based game accessible in internet browsers. The software the Gaming Room wants us to design is for the game server that will host the web application.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I think I did a good job of keeping a professional tone throughout the design document and providing thourough information in each section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I think the design document forces you to examine what the challenges will be in completing a project and helps you make informed decisions with design choices.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I still think that I have only a general understanding of how distributed networks really work. I think I could have made a more informed recommendation in that section if I       better understood a few of the concepts involved. I understand that requests and responses are sent through a network but I only understand it at that vague high-level.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  In this case the user's needs were to have a secure web host for the game and compatibility with as many browsers as possible. This is why the application uses a common           communication protocol. The user's needs are the most important consideration in designing software. Otherwise it is possible to end up with software that doesn't satisfy the     customer even though it works well. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Applications like this one that are web-based and utilize multiple programming languages functioning together are very syntax-heavy and use libraries I am unfamiliar with. In     this case we were given close examples to go by in order to complete the application. I think that is the best strategy for these types of problems, to base your work on           functioning code working in a similar "environment" because you likely won't be able to memorize all of the little details needed in order to properly set up something like a     Maven project.
